                           Regression Course Project Plan

Design:
Do momentum exist in sporting events? How closely are the four quarters in a basketball games related to each other? Can rookie players maintain their play as well as more experienced players over the courses of an entire game?
This project attempts to give actual evidences in answering these questions, by modeling point differentials scored in the last quarter in a NBA game, in relationship with the point differentials in the earlier quarters, and the experience of the players involved.

Data:
The primary data are acquired through web scraping using basketball-reference.com. The data obtained cover all games over 3 entire NBA seasons from 2016-2019, a total of 3600+ games. To avoid selection bias, all regular season games in a season are included. 

For each game, the point differentials, between points scored by the home team and points scored by the visiting team, in each quarters are recorded. Also, the top 8 players of each team, in terms of minutes played in that quarter, are recorded. The age of each of those players, the total games played in the season, and the minutes played in the preceeding quarters are recorded as features to serve as the indicator of experience/fatigue  in this project. The number of games played serves as a proxy of the practise time of the players in the season, which is not available directly.

 
Algorithms:

StatModels are used to build a linear regression model in python. A higher order terms is added if a feature is suspected to have non-linear relationship with the target. 

After the model is built, validation of the model is performed by examining the residual errors of the target. 

Tools:

Web scraping is performed using BeautifulSoup with html5lib. The scraping output is saved into SQLite database. The linear regression is performed using StatModel.
